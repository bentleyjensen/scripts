#These are scripty-things

I wanted to back up my scripts.

##Commandy things
<code>copy</code> was intended to take a file or folder, compress it, and then ssh it to my personal server 

<code>hello.sh</code> was something a friend showed me when I started bash scripting

Server/ is supposed to be all the scripts on my server. I'm building it for school and I'm trying to maek it as simple as possible for non-commandline familiar people to upload their itty bitty root folders.
